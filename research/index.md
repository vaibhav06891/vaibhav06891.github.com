My interests broadly lie in the fields of machine learning, computer vision and Deep learning. [Here](/research/courses/) is a list of all the courses I have taken, both during graduate and undergraduate studies.



- **Tesla Motors, Palo Alto, USA [Autopilot Intern – Vision]** (Fall 2017)  
 Prototyping Convolutional Neural networks for Object Detection and Tracking. <br />
 Lane detection using Probability score map, Road surface estimation using Geometric Vision techniques. 

### Projects

- **Planning and Control of Robot in Perception Space** (Fall 2016 - Spring 2018)  
 The primary focus of the research project is to find an alternative method for planning the trajectory which will enable us to remove intermediate steps of processing that are involved in traditional methods of planning.


- **SceneFlow using Deep Learning** (Spring 2018)  
 Scene flow is the dense 3D motion field of a scene and is 3D equivalent of optical flow. Developing a technique that will aid autonomous navigation and/or manipulation in dynamic environments where motion of objects needs to be predicted.

- **Vision based regrasping for better object utility** (Feb 2017 - Aug 2017)  
 To give robots the ability to learn from exploartion using reinforcement learning and/or learning from demonstration. To leverage human demonstrations of how and where to grasp object to help them best execute a task, instead of simply grasping for grasping’s sake.

- **Scene Recognition with Deep Learning** (Fall 2016)  
 Implemented AlexNet and VGG deep learning neural networks for the task of Instance Scene Recognition
on the 15 class scene dataset. Achieved upto 90% accuracy.

- **Sentiment Analysis of Tweets / Text Classification for online Articles** (Spring 2016)  
 Designed and built a machine learning model to extract the key positive and negative sentiments from the tweets. Various online news articles were classified into different news categories. Various text processing techniques like LDA, tf-idf, text lemmatization were explored.

- **Navigation aid for blind(NAVI System)** (Undergrad. Project: 2012 - 2013)  
 Purpose of the project was to aid safe mobility for vision impaired. Used concepts of vanishing points to find the orientation of user and localize
the user in the environment. Successfully developed algorithms to detect humans and static objects, estimating the distance of known obstacles
while optimizing the memory requirements. 

- **Video Sudoku solver using MATLAB** (Feb 2012 – May 2012)  
 It detects Sudoku in an image, interprets it and solves it. Artificial Neural Networks were trained for number recognition. The back propagation algorithm was used to solve the Sudoko.

- **Offline Signature Verification** (Sept 2011 - May 2012)  
 Project aimed at providing authentication using signatures of user. Curve fitting algorithm with Neural Networks was efficiently designed. Invalid / forged signatures were successfully detected enabling secured authentication.
